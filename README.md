# React Native - TheSidebar Component
Implementation of the magnificient [TheSidebarcontroller](https://github.com/jondanao/TheSidebarController) in react-native    
Not sure yet what's the best way of releasing react-native components with mixed js and Obj-C code so for now an example project will do.  

# Example of usage
```
var SideMenu = require("./sidemenu.js");
<SideMenu menu={menu} content={content}/>
```  
where menu and content are 2 views
  
# Thanks
Without @tadeuzagallo invaluable help this would have not happened
